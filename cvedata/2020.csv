CVE-2020-1603,Candidate,"Specific IPv6 packets sent by clients processed by the Routing Engine (RE) are improperly handled. These IPv6 packets are designed to be blocked by the RE from egressing the RE. Instead, the RE allows these specific IPv6 packets to egress the RE, at which point a mbuf memory leak occurs within the Juniper Networks Junos OS device. This memory leak eventually leads to a kernel crash (vmcore), or the device hanging and requiring a power cycle to restore service, creating a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. During the time where mbufs are rising, yet not fully filled, some traffic from client devices may begin to be black holed. To be black holed, this traffic must match the condition where this traffic must be processed by the RE. Continued receipt and attempted egress of these specific IPv6 packets from the Routing Engine (RE) will create an extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Scenarios which have been observed are: 1. In a single chassis, single RE scenario, the device will hang without vmcore, or a vmcore may occur and then hang. In this scenario the device needs to be power cycled. 2. In a single chassis, dual RE scenario, the device master RE will fail over to the backup RE. In this scenario, the master and the backup REs need to be reset from time to time when they vmcore. There is no need to power cycle the device. 3. In a dual chassis, single RE scenario, the device will hang without vmcore, or a vmcore may occur and then hang. In this scenario, the two chassis' design relies upon some type of network level redundancy - VRRP, GRES, NSR, etc. - 3.a In a commanded switchover, where nonstop active routing (NSR) is enabled no session loss is observed. 4. In a dual chassis, dual chassis scenario, rely upon the RE to RE failover as stated in the second scenario. In the unlikely event that the device does not switch RE to RE gracefully, then the fallback position is to the network level services scenario in the third scenario.

CVE-2020-1938,Candidate,"When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.","CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200226-0002/   |   MLIST:[ofbiz-commits] 20200227 [ofbiz-plugins] branch release17.12 updated: Upgrade Tomcat from 9.0.29 to 9.0.31 (CVE-2020-1938) (OFBIZ-11407)   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rd0774c95699d5aeb5e16e9a600fb2ea296e81175e30a62094e27e3e7@%3Ccommits.ofbiz.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[ofbiz-notifications] 20200225 [jira] [Commented] (OFBIZ-11407) Upgrade Tomcat from 9.0.29 to 9.0.31 (CVE-2020-1938)   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r856cdd87eda7af40b50278d6de80ee4b42d63adeb433a34a7bdaf9db@%3Cnotifications.ofbiz.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[ofbiz-notifications] 20200225 [jira] [Updated] (OFBIZ-11407) Upgrade Tomcat from 9.0.29 to 9.0.31 (CVE-2020-1938)   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r75113652e46c4dee687236510649acfb70d2c63e074152049c3f399d@%3Cnotifications.ofbiz.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[ofbiz-notifications] 20200227 [jira] [Commented] (OFBIZ-11407) Upgrade Tomcat from 9.0.29 to 9.0.31 (CVE-2020-1938)   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r74328b178f9f37fe759dffbc9c1f2793e66d79d7a8a20d3836551794@%3Cnotifications.ofbiz.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[ofbiz-notifications] 20200228 [jira] [Comment Edited] (OFBIZ-11407) Upgrade Tomcat from 9.0.29 to 9.0.31 (CVE-2020-1938)   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rad36ec6a1ffc9e43266b030c22ceeea569243555d34fb4187ff08522@%3Cnotifications.ofbiz.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[ofbiz-notifications] 20200228 [jira] [Commented] (OFBIZ-11407) Upgrade Tomcat from 9.0.29 to 9.0.31 (CVE-2020-1938)   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rce2af55f6e144ffcdc025f997eddceb315dfbc0b230e3d750a7f7425@%3Cnotifications.ofbiz.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[tomcat-announce] 20200224 [SECURITY] CVE-2020-1938 AJP Request Injection and potential Remote Code Execution   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r7c6f492fbd39af34a68681dbbba0468490ff1a97a1bd79c6a53610ef%40%3Cannounce.tomcat.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[tomcat-users] 20200301 Re: [SECURITY] CVE-2020-1938 AJP Request Injection and potential Remote Code Execution   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rb2fc890bef23cbc7f343900005fe1edd3b091cf18dada455580258f9@%3Cusers.tomcat.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[tomcat-users] 20200302 AW: [SECURITY] CVE-2020-1938 AJP Request Injection and potentialRemote Code Execution   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r17aaa3a05b5b7fe9075613dd0c681efa60a4f8c8fbad152c61371b6e@%3Cusers.tomcat.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[tomcat-users] 20200302 Re: AW: [SECURITY] CVE-2020-1938 AJP Request Injection and potentialRemote Code Execution   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r38a5b7943b9a62ecb853acc22ef08ff586a7b3c66e08f949f0396ab1@%3Cusers.tomcat.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[tomcat-users] 20200302 Re: [SECURITY] CVE-2020-1938 AJP Request Injection and potential Remote Code Execution   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rd50baccd1bbb96c2327d5a8caa25a49692b3d68d96915bd1cfbb9f8b@%3Cusers.tomcat.apache.org%3E",Assigned (20191202),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2020-5236,Candidate,"Waitress version 1.4.2 allows a DOS attack When waitress receives a header that contains invalid characters.

This allows an attacker to send a single request with an invalid header and take the service offline. This issue was introduced in version 1.4.2 when the regular expression was updated to attempt to match the behaviour required by errata associated with RFC7230.

CVE-2020-9330,Candidate,"Certain Xerox WorkCentre printers before 073.xxx.000.02300 do not require the user to reenter or validate LDAP bind credentials when changing the LDAP connector IP address. A malicious actor who gains access to affected devices (e.g., by using default credentials) can change the LDAP connection IP address to a system owned by the actor without knowledge of the LDAP bind credentials. After changing the LDAP connection IP address, subsequent authentication attempts will result in the printer sending plaintext LDAP (Active Directory) credentials to the actor. Although the credentials may belong to a non-privileged user, organizations frequently use privileged service accounts to bind to Active Directory.
